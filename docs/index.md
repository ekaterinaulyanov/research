Bonjour, hi! 


I am a Physics Ph.D. student with the [Grütter Research Group](https://spm.physics.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University in Montréal, Québec. I use [Atomic Force Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy) (AFM) to probe material surfaces on the atomic scale (i.e. we can see individual atoms!) to understand their fundamental properties. This research has valuable applications in nanoelectronics and sustainable energy (solar cells). I am passionate about introducing more people to the beauty of physics, both through general science communication and through teaching introductory physics courses. I’d like to invite you to join me on my journey through scholarship and research. To quote Richard Feynman, “[There's plenty of room at the bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom)!"
