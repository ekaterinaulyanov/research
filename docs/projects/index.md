# Ultrafast AFM 
<!-- [Non-contact AFM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-contact_atomic_force_microscopy)  -->
is unique in its ability to image, measure, and manipulate 2-D materials on the nanoscale. By manipulating the building units and dopants (defects) in material samples, we can control their (macroscale) optoelectronic properties. By choosing the right combination of materials and dopants, we can find materials that are high performance, low cost, environmentally sustainable candidates for nanoelectronics. 
We are interested in combining the spatial resolution provided by our AFM with time resolution. I am working to combine our low-temperature ultrahigh vacuum AFM system with an ultrafast (10 femtoseconds!) pulsed laser. This system will be unique in its combined spatial (atomic-scale) and temporal (fs) resolution, allowing us to study the structure, properties, and dynamic processes of organic polymers. We are collaborating with the 
<!-- [Perepichka Group](https://group.perepichka.com/) at McGill, who are leading experts in the chemical synthesis of new hybrid materials.   -->

# Ultrafast UED 
At Williams College, I worked in the Kealhofer Lab, which generates and manipulates ultrafast electron pulses in pump-probe
 <!-- [ultrafast electron diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafast_electron_diffraction)  -->
(UED) experiments. Basically, we use an optical pulse (pump) to excite a material sample out of equilibrium, then hit the sample with an electron pulse (probe) to detect its excited state. I worked on our Ytterbium-fiber laser 
<!-- [Chirped Pulse Amplification](https://www.rp-photonics.com/chirped_pulse_amplification.html) system, to generate short and clean optical pulses.  -->


<!-- Here are some projects that I am working on.  -->

<!-- - [Python Project](./python_project/python_project.ipynb) is an amazing python project that will allow you to see my coding skills.
- [Data Project](./data_project/index.md) is an even more amazing project where I share data that I've used. -->
